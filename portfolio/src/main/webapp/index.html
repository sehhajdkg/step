        <p>hi internet! nice to meet yall &#x1F44B;</p>
        <p>i'm sehhaj! i just finished my third year at UNSW studying a bioinformatics engineering and commerce degree. 
           slightly interesting facts about me, i have never cut my hair so it is really long. 
           my middle name is dev which means god, but also I think maybe my parents were manifesting a potential future for me as a software dev? 
           i am currently learning HTML. These are my favourite fruits and vegetables. &#x1F352;&#x1F351;&#x1F33D;&#x1F952;&#x1F347;</p>
