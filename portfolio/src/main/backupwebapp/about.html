      <p>Hi internet! Nice to meet yall "üëãüèΩ"</p>
      <p>I'm Sehhaj! I just finished my third year at UNSW studying a Bioinformatics Engineering (Hons) and Commerce degree. 
           Slightly interesting facts about me, I have never cut my hair so it is really long. 
           Also my middle name is Dev which means god, but also I think maybe my parents were manifesting a potential future for me as a software dev? 
           I am currently learning HTML as a STEP intern at Google. These are my favourite fruits and vegetables. "üçíüçëüåΩü•íüçá"</p>
